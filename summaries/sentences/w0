The meeting came a day after U.S.-led strikes, launched together with Britain and France, hit three Syrian chemical weapons facilities.
The airstrikes were in response to the suspected April 7 chemical attack in Douma, a Damascus suburb.
Despite claims by President Trump that the operation was an “enormous success,” it is being interpreted in Syria as a win for Assad because the limited scope of the strikes suggested that Western powers do not intend to challenge his rule.
On Sunday, the Syrian army command declared that it had taken full control of the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus, which had been under rebel control for six years.
As the justification for Saturday’s strikes, the United States and its allies cited what they said was “proof” that the Syrian government had carried out the attack.
