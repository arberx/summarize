There are plenty of reasons anyone who cares about good food should explore Chloe, the debut restaurant from veteran Washington chef Haidar Karoum.
Consciously or not, the chef, who has also led the decidedly different kitchens at Proof, Estadio and Doi Moi, incorporated his mentors’ best practices and came up with a style of his own: global and delightful, a sweetly spare 105-seat dining room named for Karoum’s oldest niece.
By now, you’ve probably figured out Chloe is doing what every other restaurant seems to be doing, offering “small plates meant to be shared,” as a server is likely to describe the familiar game plan.
Karoum credits his Lebanese father with a few dishes, including one his dad was known to bring to potlucks: fried cauliflower tossed in tahini and lemon juice and garnished with pine nuts and fresh mint.
Trips around the world, the lunches are a steal at $10 each.
