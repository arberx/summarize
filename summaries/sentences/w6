The Congressional Budget Office last week released its annual budget and economic outlook report, and although the news was gruesome, the report was greeted in Washington with a giant yawn.
The assumption among Republicans and Democrats is that the political rewards for curbing runaway budget deficits are too meager to justify the risks.
There’s a consensus to do nothing — and to hope that nothing goes disastrously wrong.
There can no longer be any pretense that the deficits reflect the aftermath of the Great Recession or other temporary forces.
The main cause is political expediency: It’s more popular to increase spending and cut taxes than the opposite.
