Laura Ingraham returned from Easter break defiant, saying an advertiser revolt that stripped her Fox News show of half its sponsors was a result of “bullies on the left” and “left-wing retaliatory hit squads” that were trying to silence conservatives.
But SNL’s Kate McKinnon, playing Ingraham on the show’s “Weekend Update” segment, painted the beleaguered host as mostly unfazed by the uproar surrounding her costly online feud with Parkland, Fla., shooting survivor David Hogg.
In March, Ingraham mocked Hogg’s public comments about getting rejection letters from colleges.
He responded by calling for a boycott of her show, and Ingraham lost more than a dozen advertisers, including Johnson & Johnson, Nestlé, Hulu, Jenny Craig, Ruby Tuesday and Miracle-Ear.
During Ingraham’s vacation, Jack Abernethy, co-president of Fox News, said in a statement: “We cannot and will not allow voices to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts. We look forward to having Laura Ingraham back hosting her program next Monday when she returns from spring vacation with her children.”
