Starbucks, which has touted its progressive values and its “social impact” agenda, faces fierce criticism and calls for a boycott after two black men were arrested at a Philadelphia store, sparking accusations of racial profiling over what the company’s chief executive called a “reprehensible” incident.
Her clients, who declined to be identified, were released eight hours later because of lack of evidence of a 
crime, she said, adding that the Starbucks manager was white.
A store manager had asked the two men to leave after they asked to use the bathroom but had not made any purchases, police said.
The men declined to leave and said they were waiting for a friend, their attorney later said.
The moment has drawn comparisons to civil-disobedience protests during the civil rights movement, when black Americans’ refusals to leave segregated lunch counters were met with police force.
